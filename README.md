**Pharmaceutical Sales Prediction**
**Overview**

This project aims to predict pharmaceutical sales across multiple Rossmann stores using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to provide Rossmann Pharmaceuticals with accurate sales forecasts for six weeks in advance, enabling better planning and decision-making for store managers and the finance team.

**Objectives**

Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior: Understand factors affecting purchasing behavior using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
Sales Prediction: Build machine learning models using sklearn and deep learning models using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) to predict daily sales.
Model Serving on a Web Interface: Deploy a dashboard for managers to input parameters and receive sales predictions.

**Tasks**
Task 1: Customer Purchasing Behavior Exploration
Conduct EDA to assess the impact of factors such as promotions, holidays, seasonality, and competition on sales.
Task 2: Sales Prediction
Preprocess data and implement tree-based and deep learning models for sales prediction.
Serialize and save models for reproducibility.
Task 3: Web Interface for Predictions
Build and deploy a user-friendly dashboard for inputting parameters and viewing prediction results.

**Learning Outcomes**
Gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering.
Build predictive models using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
Deploy models with Flask or Streamlit, creating a functional web app for real-time predictions.

**Features**
Data cleaning and visualization
Machine learning pipeline construction
Deep learning model with LSTM for time series
Web app deployment on Heroku or similar platforms
